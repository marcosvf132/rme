What is this?
=============

This is my edited version of the remeres map editor. This edited version include the option 'generate house data', this one creates a data file that my edited version of the Assets-Editor (Client 12) use it to read all the house information on your map and set it to your client. The reason for this one is to properly show your map on the cyclopedia 'house' tab.

The generated .dat file need to be imported to your assets using this [Assets-Editor version.](https://github.com/marcosvf132/Assets-Editor/tree/main)

This is a map editor for OpenTibia, which is an open source implementation of the MMORPG Tibia (which can be found at [tibia.com](http://tibia.com)), the official website is [remeresmapeditor.com](http://remeresmapeditor.com).
You can find the project for hosting your own server at [the otserv project](https://github.com/opentibia/server).
The main fansite for help, discussion and servers is [otland.net](http://otland.net).
